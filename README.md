analysis of student standardized testing scores 

The data used in this analysis comes from http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams. This is a fictional dataset that was created for the use of data science training. 

I recently developed a passion for data analysis/coding and this is my first dataset analysis using R. The purpose of this excercise was to become comfortable writing code in RStudio and exlore the different features it has to offer.
